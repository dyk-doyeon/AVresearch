          JANE AKINYI: My name is Jane Akinyi. I am a self-advocate from Kenya. I was born
          with this intellectual disability. <br>
          What I see, it is very, very few people understands people with intellectual disability. It's not many. Sometimes they're telling us, “You are stupid. You cannot be able to make decisions like other people.” <br>
          When we can be able to speak up, we can able to tell them, “We have equal rights like you. We can able to make decision like you.”<br>
          We have the right to be employment like other persons. We have right to live
          independently like other persons.<br> <br>
